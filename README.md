# override - 42 Security Project

This repository contains the complete solutions for the **override** project. The project follows the RainFall project and focuses on teaching binary exploitation techniques for ELF-like binaries on i386 systems.

## Project Overview

override is designed to raise awareness about common programming vulnerabilities and security issues. Through hands-on exploitation of intentionally vulnerable C programs, students learn about buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other low-level security concepts. The project emphasizes understanding RAM layout and developing secure coding practices.

## Levels Structure

The project consists of 10 levels (level00 through level09), with levels 00-08 being mandatory and level09 as bonus. Each level directory follows the required structure:

- `flag`: Contains the password/flag obtained for the next level
- `source`: A readable version of the vulnerable C code.
- `resources`: Step-by-step explanation of the exploitation process
